# Eat-More-UI
 A complete UI for a casual game.
## Overview
 Eat-More-UI is a simple functional UI for a casual game. It has more unique features as *Fish-Eye ScrollView*.
## Features
 Eat-More-UI's features mostly developed on demand. There some basic features like **Pulse Logo** and there is more complicated ones like **Fish-Eye ScrollView**. Detailed information is down below.
### Indicators
 Fundamental principle of *Indicators* is showing players what they have in game. I keep that in mind then add some fluidity in UI. *Indicators* have 3 layers to solve fluidity problem. First layer keeps the data, second layer offers background for *Indicator* and last layer just mimics the information first layer has. After layers set, *Indicators* works perfectly for every digit.
### Pulse Logo
 Unity3D animation controlled UI element. It has a distinct behaviour of sliding shine effect on it.
### Level Bar
 *Level Bar* has two different behaviour. One of them is to show players progression and the other is to inform players level update. Each behaviour totally programmed dynamically and it can be used various purposes. When players come to Main UI, *Level Bar* responsible to animate new progression. Progression data comes from PlayerData and *Level Bar's* progression percentage must be calculated. If there is a **level-up** situation appears in calculation and *Level Bar* animates its icon to inform players.
